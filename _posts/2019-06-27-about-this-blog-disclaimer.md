**Programming is easy**. You have some requirements, and you, the programmer are put in the position to translate those requirements into another language that the computer understands and executes. Well, this is my opinion - as everything else on [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/opinion):

> an idea that is believed to be true or valid without positive knowledge

**Writing is not so easy**. Because the target of the communication is fuzzy, not like the language that the computer understands. The target is *you*, the unique person, who stumbled over my blog. And you, with your perspective, are unique.

**The promise** I make to the *world*, and *me*, is that I'll do my best to present randomly complex ideas as clearly as possible, in fields such as programming, security and life.

**Disclaimer**: Any posts published here represent solely my view, and should not be taken as any kind of universal rule.
