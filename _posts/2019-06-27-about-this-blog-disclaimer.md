# About this Blog

**Programming is easy**. You have some requirements, and you, the programmer are put in the position to translate those requirements into another language that the computer understands and executes. Well, this is [my opinion](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/opinion) - as everything else on here:

> an idea that is believed to be true or valid without positive knowledge

**Writing is not so easy**. Because the target audience is fuzzy, not like the language that the computer understands. It's you, the unique person, who stumbled over my blog, but also the future me.

**The promise** I make to the *world*, and *me*, is that I'll do my best to present randomly complex ideas as clearly as possible, in fields such as programming, security and life.
