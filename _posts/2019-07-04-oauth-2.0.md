OAuth 2.0 is an open standard for authorization, published as [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) in October 2012.

OAuth 2.0 enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol.

OAuth defines four roles:
- resource owner (eg. the end-user)
- resource server (the server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens)
- client (the application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner)
- authorization server (the server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization)
