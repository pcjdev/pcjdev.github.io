Welcome to my git-based and integrity-protected blog and website!

About Me
=========

Short Description
------------------

Full-Stack (mostly Java) Developer with a keen interest in Cryptography
and other Information Security topics.

Some Details
-------------

_Full-Stack_ - it's a broad term, in my opinion, and if you frown on hearing it,
I know what you feel. I just use it here with the meaning: I can do _stuff_,
from HTML/CSS/JavaScript to Java/Python/ShellScripting and databases.

_mostly Java_ - because Java is what I excel at, but I am trying to improve
my Python or JavaScript skills, and bring them to the same level.
I'm an Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 6 Programmer.

_Developer_ - that's that I am. A clean one. And I like to say that I craft things.

_Information Security_, and especially _Cryptography_ - this is my true passion.
If Java is my second (after the mother) language, Crypto and InfoSec are my heart.

_Why the Full Name is missing?_ - because I am conscientious about my privacy
and I want to have the control of my online presence. I refer select people from
my real life to this online persona.
